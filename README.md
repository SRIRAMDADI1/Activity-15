# Activity-15
## This repo is for STAT-184 to show my understanding of basic Github actions.
## Currently I hope to make a comprehensive collection of files, commits, branches and issues to meet the requirements of the assignment. 
## The repo has a test file where I test commits, pull requests and the first issue. It also has a pdf regarding the output file and a qmd file that is meant to produce that output.
